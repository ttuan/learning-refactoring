# Learning Refactoring

## Process

- 📚 Read the code to understand what it does and how it works.
- 🦨 Read the code and check for design and code smells. Make a list of all code and design smells that you find.
- 🧑‍🔬 Analyze what you would have to change to implement the new requirement without refactoring the code.
- 🧪 Write a characterization test. Expand your list of code and design smells. Add those smells that you missed earlier and discovered now because they made your life writing a test miserable.
- 🔧 Refactor the code.
- 🔧 Refactor the test.
- 👼 Test-drive the new feature.
